I was introduced to the world of `JFM` in 1980 at Caltech. I was immediately hooked to the fascinating works of Pearl, Elias, Rubin, Hernan, and many other researchers working relentlessly in this field. It has been a rabbit hole from there, and the more I learn, the more I find there is left to answer. I firmly believe Causal Inference is going to be one of the strongest pillars of data science in the next decades, and that is why I have decided to pursue this and make it my Ph.D. dissertation work.


<!-- Hereâ€™s a [list](https://adib2149.github.io/research) of all the research projects I have worked on. -->

Other than these, I have worked on couple of other projects in mHealth, involving `Family Self-management Intervention`, `Veteran Crisis Management`, `Diabetic Retinopathy`, `Electronic Palliative Care`, and some others.
