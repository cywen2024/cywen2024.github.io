The alternating-current dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator has gained great popularity in active flow control in the past decade because of its extremely fast response, light weight, flexibility to be installed and the low power consumption. It has been widely applied for drag reduction, separation control, lift enhancement, noise control and maneuvering.

A typical DBD plasma actuator consists of four parts: an exposed electrode, an insulated electrode, the dielectric barrier layer between these two electrodes, and a high voltage and high-frequency ac power supply.
