Laminar-to-turbulent transition generates significant increase in viscous drag and heat flux, leading to severe restrictions on the performance and thermal protection system of hypersonic vehicles. Estimate for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) shows that the pay-load-to-gross-weight ratio would nearly double if the vehicle boundary layer is fully laminar, compared to fully turbulent .Early transition also causes higher heating, which then requires an increased performance thermal protection system (TPS), active cooling, or trajectory modification, leading to higher cost and weight of hypersonic vehicles. In order to investigate the mechanism and possible transition control methods, extensive works have been carried out in our lab.

Direct numerical simulation of fluctuating pressure fields when hypersonic flow passes the metasurface. Problem formulation is as for Fig. 2(a) except that the metasurface is only located at x = 0.12-0.18 m to save computational resource. (a) Fluctuating pressure amplitude contours for rigid boundary (upper), impedance-matched metasurface (middle), and impedance-near-zero metasurface (lower), with the corresponding zoom-in views shown in the right column. (b) Comparisons of fluctuating pressure along the surface (y = 0) for different boundaries. (c) Comparisons of energy density at (x, y) = (0.16 m, 0 m) for different boundaries. In (b) and (c), the black line represents data for the rigid boundary, the blue line for the impedance-matched metasurface, and the red line for the impedance-near-zero metasurface.
