Recently, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have garnered substantial attention from both the academia and the industry. Providing a promising alternative solution to replace human operators, UUVs showcase their unprecedented applicability in various scenarios. However, UUVs still fall short of achieving full autonomy and current practices often require human-in-the-loop technique to guarantee the success of missions, particularly in addressing uncertainties in motion control. Therefore, the control problem of UUVs needs to be further investigated.
