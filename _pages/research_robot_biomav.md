This project is to design, analyze, and build an agile palm-sized bio-inspired flapping MAV, using the precision machining methods, such as Rapid Prototyping 3D printing, Electrical Discharge Machining and Laser Micromachining techniques.

Experimental research has been carried out, to understand the aerodynamic characteristic of the current MAV design; in order to relate the flow pattern especially the vortices topology to the force generation, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system has been established as well as the force measurement by the load cell.
