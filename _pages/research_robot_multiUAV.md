Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to understand data like human being. In our research, we apply deep learning to solve different UAV problems, such as end-to-end perception, navigation, and control.

Experimental research has been carried out, to understand the aerodynamic characteristic of the current MAV design; in order to relate the flow pattern especially the vortices topology to the force generation, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system has been established as well as the force measurement by the load cell.


<!-- Hereâ€™s a [list](https://adib2149.github.io/research) of all the research projects I have worked on. -->

Other than these, I have worked on couple of other projects in mHealth, involving `Family Self-management Intervention`, `Veteran Crisis Management`, `Diabetic Retinopathy`, `Electronic Palliative Care`, and some others.
